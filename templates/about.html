<p>
With the changes anticipated in the structure and source of health insurance legislated by the newly enacted Affordable Care Act, the responsibility for managing your own wellness will be more important than ever. Fostering a spirit of caring and public health awareness is an integral component for success at both a personal and community level. Research suggests that individuals with emotional support during illness may experience shorter durations and perceive less suffering.
