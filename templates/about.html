<h2>Welcome to PoorMe!</h2>
<p>
PoorMe is a web (and soon mobile) app that puts the "Public" back in Public Health!  For common, preventable illnesses including influenza, the common cold, and foodborne disease, many people don't report their symptoms to a doctor and are therefore invisible to the public health organizations charged with preventing disease and stopping outbreaks.</p><br>
<p>
As a result, outbreak investigations and estimates of disease burden are delayed and inefficient. This means more illness and lost productivity in our communities. PoorMe aims to solve this problem.</p><br>
<p>
We're creating an app where its easy for people can take care of themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.  PoorMe users can do this by:
</p><br>
<ol>
<li>Sharing symptoms anonymously that contribute to real time maps and data on who's sick in your city, and where.</li>
<li>Connecting with other sick friends in your social network by offering advice, sympathy, empathy and stories.</li>
<li>Supporting sick friends and local business through one-click delivery of goodies like soup, a free dog-walk, or other things that make life easier for friends under the weather.</li>
</ol><br>
<p>
PoorMe is the result of a Startup Weekend (<a href="http://www.startupweekend.org">http://www.startupweekend.org</a>) collaboration among 6 people who joined forces over a common interest in crowdsourced public health.  We encourage you to contact us with ideas, bug reports or collaborations.</p><br>
